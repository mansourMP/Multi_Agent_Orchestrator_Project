# Empyralis Platform

## Overview

Empyralis is an enterprise-grade operating system for building, running, and governing AI workers. The platform provides six integrated workspace surfaces — Sage, Agents, Discover, Applications, Agent Computer, and Settings — each backed by a service-oriented Python backend and a Next.js 16 frontend with React 19.

The platform supports multi-tenant workspaces, multi-channel agent deployment, a governed marketplace, hosted mini-applications, and local hardware execution through a secure gateway protocol.

---

## Workspace Surfaces

The workspace shell presents six navigation destinations, each with defined child routes.

### 1. Sage

**Destination ID:** `sage`
**Icon:** `message-square`
**Default route:** `chat`

Sage is the primary AI intelligence bound to each workspace. It maintains a persistent identity, layered memory, and governs interactions across all channels.

#### Routes

| Route | Segment | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chat` | `sage` | Sage | Primary conversational interface. Real-time turn-based chat with full thread history, tool use, and channel awareness. |
| `memory` | `memory` | Memory | Timeline view of Sage interactions, memory recalls, and agent actions. |
| `integrations` | `integrations` | Connections | MCP server connections, tool contracts, provider configuration, and API service management. |
| `channels` | `channels` | Connections | Per-channel inbound and outbound message routing configuration. |
| `tasks` | `tasks` | Tasks | Scheduled and heartbeat-based agent tasks with recurring run schedules. |
| `artifacts` | `artifacts` | Library | Persistent documents, knowledge sources, and generated content managed by Sage. |
| `approvals` | `approvals` | Approvals | Human-in-the-loop approval gates for actions Sage or agents request. Hidden from web navigation; accessible via mobile bottom tabs. |
| `notifications` | `notifications` | Activity | Real-time activity notifications across all workspace surfaces. Hidden from web navigation; primary mobile tab. |
| `activity` | `activity` | Activity | Execution history of Sage tasks, run traces, and event logs. Hidden from web navigation. |

#### Core Capabilities

- **Persistent Identity**: Sage maintains a stable identity bound to the workspace via Soul.md, Identity.md, and Heartbeat.md memory files.
- **Layered Memory Architecture**: Four-tier memory system — Profile Memory (long-term), Episodic Memory (interactions), Local Private (on-device), Cloud Synced (encrypted). Memory is permissioned and private by design.
- **Safety Control Plane**: Granular governance for every turn. Approval gates, audit streams, and egress policy enforcement. Quotas, entitlements, and policy-bound runtime placement.
- **Provider Routing**: Model selection and provider routing with tier-based contracts. Empyralis credits always route to DeepSeek (best quality-to-price ratio). Users can bring their own API key for other providers via "My API Key" tier.
- **Skills System**: Installable callable tools that extend Sage's capabilities. Skills are registered in a workspace-scoped registry.
- **Transparency Timeline**: Every interaction produces a verifiable transparency record showing tool calls, memory loads, approvals, and provider decisions.
- **Context Files**: Knowledge retrieval augmented generation with file upload support (.md, .txt, .csv, .json).

### 2. Agents

**Destination ID:** `studio`
**Icon:** `boxes`
**Label in navigation:** Agents
**Default route:** `studio`
**Requires capability:** `workspace_admin_enabled`

The Agents surface is the studio for creating, configuring, deploying, and managing AI agents. It supports native agents built from templates as well as externally connected agents.

#### Routes

| Route | Segment | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `studio` | `studio` | Agents | Agent roster with list and detail views. Create agents from templates or from scratch. View deployed agent status (live, draft, blocked). |
| `inbox` | `inbox` | Messages | Message inbox for deployed agents showing inbound messages across all connected channels. |
| `deploy` | `deploy` | Go Live | Deployment and rollout controls. Bind agents to production channels with configuration validation. |
| `studioIntegrations` | `studio-integrations` | Integrations | Channel account linking, credential management, and agent-to-channel binding. Hidden from web navigation. |

#### Agent Detail Tabs

Each agent in the roster exposes a detail view with the following tabs:

- **Overview (Command Center)**: Agent identity, description, status badges, launch readiness checklist, recent test message preview, deploy blockers, and cost/usage signals.
- **Chat (Playground)**: Private test conversation surface with full chat transcript, transparency timeline, and the same tool/model controls as production.
- **Knowledge**: Agent purpose (system prompt / instructions) and trusted data sources. File upload with retrieval health metrics and search test capability.
- **Model (AI Settings)**: Provider connection, model selection, provider catalog, model tier and routing configuration.
- **Actions**: Tool and action configuration for the agent.
- **Memory**: Conversation memory policy — how the agent retains and forgets conversation history.
- **Integrations**: Channel bindings and credential management.
- **Results**: Analytics dashboard with message volume, cost tracking, and quality metrics.

#### Agent Types

- **Template-based Agents**: Built from marketplace agent templates with pre-configured behaviors, channels, data needs, and safety policies. Templates include business-specific configurations (restaurant orders, auto parts sales, real estate leads, support FAQ, appointment booking, and more).
- **Custom Agents**: Built from scratch with full control over all configuration dimensions.
- **Connected External Agents**: API-based external agents registered in the workspace and integrated into the chat routing system.

#### Agent Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Agent created but not yet deployed. Editable in all dimensions.
2. **Test**: Private test conversations available. Behavior validated before going live.
3. **Live**: Deployed to one or more channels. Production traffic routed per channel bindings.
4. **Blocked**: Deployment blocked by policy, missing configuration, or approval requirements.

#### Studio Capabilities

- **Register provider packages** with model rosters, auth modes, capability labels, jurisdictions, privacy postures, and monetization configurations.
- **Review pending submissions** — approve or reject community app submissions before they appear in Discover.

#### Monetization

Packages support four monetization models:
- **Free**: No charge; uses workspace credits for messages and actions.
- **Metered**: Usage-based billing.

- **Active Sessions**: Timed, signed tokens for app active sessions with scope verification.

#### App Store

A browsable app store surface allows workspace members to discover and install applications, distinct from the Discover marketplace which focuses on agent templates, skills, and connectors.
