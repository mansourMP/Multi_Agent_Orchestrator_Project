# Canonical Architecture Contract

Last verified: 2026-04-13
Phase: A
Prompt: 01
Status: Defined now, not yet fully enforced

This document freezes the launch-path architecture rules for the active runtime.
It is the source of truth for how turn ingress, deployed-agent ingress, memory,
quota, and cost accounting are supposed to fit together before deeper
enforcement work in later prompts.

## Architecture Truths

1. A deployed agent is not a separate engine.
   A deployed agent is deployment configuration layered on top of the canonical
   turn engine.

2. Telegram, WhatsApp, web, and future channels are shells.
   Channels own ingress normalization and egress formatting only.
   Channels do not own a separate product brain, policy engine, memory engine,
   or run engine.

3. `server_modules/agent_turn.py` is the canonical turn contract.
   All user-facing and system-facing work must become an
   `AgentTurnRequest` before execution.

4. `server_modules/turn_runtime.py` is the execution switchboard.
   It decides whether a canonical turn resolves through direct chat or durable
   execution. It is not an alternate engine.

5. `server_modules/agent_channel_router.py` is the external channel ingress
   adapter.
   It resolves channel owner, identity, preflight policy, memory/quota
   overlays, then hands one canonical turn into `agent_turn.py`.

6. `server.py` is the composition root only.
   It mounts routers, lifecycle, middleware, and shared service wiring.
   It must not contain product logic.

## Canonical Paths

### A. Web Turn Ingress

```txt
server.py
-> runtime_runs_api.py /turn
-> agent_turn.resolve_direct_chat_turn_request() or request_body_to_turn_request()
-> agent_turn.normalize_server_owned_turn_request()
-> agent_turn.agent_turn()
-> turn_runtime.execute_agent_turn_request()
-> direct chat execution OR durable execution
-> normalized result
```

Boundary rule:
Public web chat enters through `/turn`.
No other web route is allowed to invent a parallel turn ingress contract.

### B. Durable Run Start

```txt
caller
-> turn_runtime.execute_run_start_request_via_turn_runtime()
-> run_service.execute_run_start_request_via_turn_runtime()
-> agent_turn.resolve_run_start_turn_request()
-> execute_durable_turn_request()
```

Boundary rule:
A run start is a specialized canonical turn ingress.
It is not a separate product execution path.

### C. Deployed-Agent Channel Ingress

```txt
connector or internal channel route
-> agent_channel_router.route_inbound_channel_message()
-> agent_channel_router.prepare_canonical_channel_turn()
-> agent_channel_router._build_channel_turn_request()
-> agent_channel_router.execute_prepared_channel_turn()
-> agent_channel_router.execute_canonical_channel_turn()
-> agent_turn.execute_system_agent_turn()
-> agent_turn.agent_turn()
-> turn_runtime.execute_agent_turn_request()
```

Boundary rule:
All public deployed-agent channel traffic must converge on
`route_inbound_channel_message()`.
No connector may create a separate deployed-agent execution contract.

### D. Memory

Current public deployed-agent path:

```txt
agent_channel_router.route_inbound_channel_message()
-> deployed_agent_memory_service.load_deployed_agent_memory_context()
-> _build_channel_turn_request(prior_messages, business_plan)
-> agent_turn.agent_turn()
-> deployed_agent_memory_service.persist_deployed_agent_memory_snapshot()
```

Boundary rule:
Memory is assembled before canonical turn execution.
`agent_turn` owns thread/session persistence, not channel-history lookup.
Connectors must never load or persist conversation memory directly.

### E. Quota And Throttling

Current public-channel path:

```txt
agent_channel_router.route_inbound_channel_message()
-> deployed_agent_rate_limit_service.enforce_deployed_agent_daily_message_limit()
-> agent_channel_router.execute_prepared_channel_turn()
-> channel_concurrency_service.channel_execution_slot()
```

Boundary rule:
Product quota and transport concurrency are separate controls, but both must be
applied inside the canonical channel ingress path.
Connectors must not invent their own user-visible limit behavior.

### F. Cost Accounting

Canonical path:

```txt
agent_turn.agent_turn()
-> turn_runtime / run_service durable execution
-> usage snapshot generation
-> usage_reporting.usage_row_from_snapshot()
-> deployed_agent_cost_cap_service.settle_deployed_agent_monthly_cost_cap()
-> control_plane_repository monthly deployment ledger
```

Boundary rule:
Pricing, burn, caps, and analytics must derive from one usage-accounting chain.
No connector or UI surface may compute deployment burn independently.

## Forbidden Bypass Paths

These bypasses are architecture debt. They should be removed or wrapped behind
the canonical boundaries in later prompts.

1. Direct construction of `AgentTurnRequest` outside `agent_turn.py` request
   builders.
   Current repo status: no known production-code violations.

2. Direct execution of canonical turns from route/controller code outside the
   canonical ingress surfaces.
   Current repo status: no known production-code violations.

3. Direct `create_run()` from connector flows for user-facing work.
   Compatibility callback names are allowed only when they resolve into
   `turn_runtime` run-start bridging or canonical channel routing.
   Current violations:
   - `server_modules/connectors/whatsapp_webhook_service.py`
   - `server_modules/connectors/discord_connector.py`
   - `server_modules/runs_execution.py`

4. Connector bootstrap code calling system turn/run execution directly.
   Compatibility bootstrap wrappers are acceptable only when they delegate
   immediately into `turn_ingress_service` or `turn_runtime`.
   Current violations:
   - `server_modules/runtime_run_delegation_service.py`
   - `server_modules/runtime_run_replay_service.py`
   - `server_modules/runtime_webhook_trigger_service.py`
   - `server_modules/demo_workflows.py`

5. Channel-specific memory reads/writes outside the memory policy owner.

6. Channel-specific quota messaging outside the canonical channel ingress path.

7. Independent cost or burn calculations outside the usage-accounting chain.

## Allowed Entry Surfaces

1. `server_modules/runtime_runs_api.py` `/turn`
   The canonical public web turn ingress.

2. `server_modules/turn_runtime.py` run-start functions
   The canonical run-start ingress functions.

3. `server_modules/agent_channel_router.py`
   `route_inbound_channel_message()`
   The canonical public deployed-agent channel ingress.

4. `server_modules/agent_channel_router.py`
   `route_transport_channel_message()`
   Transitional transport-channel ingress that must converge toward the same
   policy model as `route_inbound_channel_message()`.

## Decision Rules

1. If a new surface needs execution, it must produce an `AgentTurnRequest` and
   enter through the canonical turn path.

2. If a new surface needs a durable run, it must enter through turn-runtime
   run-start bridging, not `create_run()` directly.

3. If a new channel is added, it is a shell only.

4. If a deployed agent needs behavior, it is config plus policy overlays on the
   same engine.

5. If a feature cannot be explained as config over the canonical turn engine,
   it is probably architectural drift.
